                Installing CASH.
								
The easiest way to find CASH is via the web-page:

"http://www-binf.bio.uu.nl/~rdb/software.html"

To extract the tarfile and to compile CASH:

Uncompress the tarfile:             uncompress cashXXX.tar.Z
Extract the tarfile:                tar xvof cashXXX.tar
Go into the library directory:      cd lib
Make the library:                   make all

Read the install entry in the makefile to set the
include and lib directory where you want to install CASH.

Then:
To install libcash.a and cash.h:    make install
Go into the examples directory:     cd ../examples

Check the makefile, and edit it so it finds the CASH library.

Make the Game of Life example:      make life
Execute the Game of Life:           life

Have fun with it.

=======================================================================
History:

cash 2.01 (June 2004):
- cleaned up a bug in PlaneFree()
Otherwise identical to cash2003.

Differences between CASH version 2003 and earlier versions

1. CASH was upgraded to ANSI C
2. CASH was made compatible with C++ by adding
   #ifdef __cplusplus extern "C" { #endif to the cash.h file
3. The Motion function was debugged and now uses the Margolus algorithm

With thanks to Ludo Pagie and Roeland Merks

=======================================================================

Differences between CASH version 2000 and earlier versions

1. CASH now makes .png files for you.
2. A bug in ColorRandom was removed

=======================================================================

Differences between CASH version 99 and earlier versions

1. The CASH library now supports visuals other than 8 bit PseudoColor.
By default, the X11-driver prompts the X11-server for an 8 bit PseudoColor
visual, but if this not availabe it selects a generic mode supporting all
sorts of visuals and depths.  The 8 bit PseudoColor mode should be a lot
faster than the generic mode, but may have the disadvantage of colors 
swicthing when the mouse moves in and out of the window.

In case you prefer the generic mode, you can make this the default by
chaing the line static int pseudoCol8 = 1; into static int pseudoCol8 = 0;
in the lib/x11.c file.

November, 1999.

=======================================================================

Differences between CASH version 95.10 and earlier versions

1. Since I myself never remembered the order of the
arguments for the colortable routines (ColorTable, 
ColorRamp, ColorWheel, and ColorRandom) I have changed
the format into ColorXxxx(starting point, end point, ....);

2. The names of all graphics functions have been made 
consistent. So all graphics functions (X11, Postscript, and Movies)
are now allowed for both CASH Planes and for arbitrary 
unsigned char blocks. For reasons of uniformity the names of
several routines has unfortunately been changed:

   OpenGraphics        =>      OpenDisplay
   DisplayAt           =>      PlaneDisplay
   DisplayPlane        =>      PlaneDisplay
   DisplayRow          =>      RowDisplay
   DisplayBlock        =>      BlockDisplay
   FastDisplayBlock    =>      BlockDisplayFast
   CloseGraphics       =>      CloseDisplay

   OpenPS              =>      OpenPostscript
   PlanePS             =>      PlanePostscript
   DumpPS              =>      PlanePostscript
   BlockPS             =>      BlockPostscript
   RowPS               =>      RowPostscript
   TextPS              =>      TextPostscript
   PagePS              =>      PagePostscript
   ClosePS             =>      ClosePostscript

   OpenMV(a,"w")       =>      OpenMovie(a,nrows,ncols)
   OpenMV(a,"r")       =>      LoadMovie(a,&nrows,&ncols)
   WriteMV(a)          =>      PlaneMovie(a,row,col,offset)
   LoadMV              =>      PlayMovie

Also the order of the (x,y) arguments of the above
routines has been reversed. First sypplu the row and
then the column where you want to place your graphics.

4. You can use the Perl script cash_upgrade to upgrade
an old CASH code to version 95.9. Except for the Movie
calls will old CASH codes still run under version 95.9
(for different colortables however) because most old
function names remain present as macros to their new
counterparts.

5. The BinSum() function has changed. The format
now is BinSum(a,n,b,c,..,h); where a,b,c..,h are
Planes and n is an integer telling how many Planes
are provided as arguments to be summed into Plane a.
The old BinSum() which had an array of Planes as its
argument is still available as BinSumOld(a,b[],n);
